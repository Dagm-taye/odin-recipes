    <h1>What Is Pasta Fagioli?</h1>
    <p>Pasta fagioli (or pasta e fagioli), which means "pasta and beans," is a traditional Italian soup. 
    It consists of small noodles (such as ditalini or macaroni) and cannellini beans in a seasoned tomato broth.</p>
    <p>Store your (completely cooled) leftover pasta e fagioli in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days. 
    We don't recommend freezing this soup, as the pasta will likely become unpleasantly mushy during the thawing process.
