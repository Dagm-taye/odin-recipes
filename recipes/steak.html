    <h1>What Is Slow Cooker Pepper Steak?</h1>
    <p>This slow cooker pepper steak always comes out tender and flavorful and is one of our family's favorites. 
        It's great to make ahead of time and serve over rice, egg noodles, or chow mein.</p>
    <p>Store your (completely cooled) leftover pasta e fagioli in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days. 
    We don't recommend freezing this soup, as the pasta will likely become unpleasantly mushy during the thawing process.
